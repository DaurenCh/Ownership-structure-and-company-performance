    "## <center>Objectives</center>\n",
    "The primary objective of this thesis is to investigate the relationship between ownership structure and firm performance in Russian publicly listed companies during the period from 2014 to 2018. The study focuses on assessing how both managerial and state shareholdings influence the performance of these firms. To achieve this, the analysis begins with an examination of individual firm-level data. Subsequently, a portfolio-based approach is employed to evaluate the impact of state ownership on the stock performance of these firms (refer to the notebook titled 'Portfolio Performance T-test'). The evaluation of firm performance is based on average values of market-to-book equity ratio (M/B) and return on assets (ROA) for the years 2015 to 2018. The ownership structure of the companies is measured using data from the year 2014. The complete text of this thesis is available for reference in [Electronic Theses & Dissertations Center](http://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num=ysu158920696033375)."

    "### Empirical method\n",
    "#### Investigating Firm Performance and Ownership Structure\n",
    "In this analysis, we utilize both standard linear and two-stage least-squares regressions to explore the relationship between ownership structure and firm performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Standard Linear Regression vs. Two-Stage Least-Squares Regression\n",
    "Standard Linear Regression: Typically, standard linear regression assumes that errors in the dependent variable are uncorrelated with independent variables. However, when explanatory variables are endogenous (correlated with the error terms), linear regression using ordinary least squares (OLS) can produce inconsistent model estimates, leading to incorrect results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two-Stage Least-Squares Regression: To address endogeneity, we turn to two-stage least-squares regression. This approach employs instrumental (control) variables that are uncorrelated with the error terms. In the first stage, these instrumental variables are used to compute estimated values of the problematic predictor(s). Then, in the second stage, these calculated values are employed to determine a linear regression model of the dependent variable. Academics consider this two-stage model optimal as it produces consistent results even when instrumental variables are weak. However, it's important to note that if the instrumental variables are weak, the estimated coefficients in the two-stage regression can still be biased, although possibly consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Factors and Instrumental Variables\n",
    "Apart from ownership structure, various factors can impact a company's performance, including its size and the quality of its workforce. Moreover, these unobserved factors may simultaneously influence both ownership structure and the market-to-book equity ratio (M/B). To address this complexity, we introduce two instrumental variables: capital expenditures and long-term debt. Data on these variables is extracted from firms' financial statements. Specifically, capital expenditures are obtained from cash flow statements, while long-term debt information is collected from balance sheets. We normalize these values by dividing them by total assets to make them compatible with the M/B ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use of Long-Term Debt and Capital Expenditures as Instrumental Variables\n",
    "Long-term debt serves as an instrumental variable because it correlates with a firm's market value. This relationship is attributed to the existence of tax subsidies on interest payments, causing the firm's value to increase with the amount of debt financing. Higher debt, holding other factors constant, leads to a higher market valuation of the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Capital expenditures are employed as a second instrumental variable due to evidence suggesting that higher investments are associated with a higher firm value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Differentiating Managerial and State Ownership\n",
    "Given the different motivations of managers and the state, we treat managerial shareholdings as a possible endogenous variable in our analysis. In contrast, we do not employ state-owned stock for the endogeneity test. We assume that managerial ownership is driven by the goal of maximizing personal income, while state ownership is primarily control-driven. Consequently, we use distinct instrumental variables for state and managerial ownership.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inclusion of Dummy Variables\n",
    "In our regression analysis, we incorporate several dummy variables to account for industry-specific effects:\n",
    "\n",
    "Electric Utility Industry: 51 out of the 213 companies analyzed are associated with the electric utility industry, which is heavily regulated by the state, particularly concerning electricity tariffs. Additionally, 28 companies from this industry are directly controlled by the state. To capture the financial performance disparities in this sector, we introduce a dummy variable for electric utilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commercial Banks: Recognizing the high level of regulation in the commercial banking sector, we include a dummy variable for commercial banks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### M/B Analysis and Dummy Variables\n",
    "In the context of M/B analysis, we employ a dummy variable to categorize companies as undervalued or overvalued based on the M/B ratio. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the M/B of a firm exceeds one or is less than zero, we classify it as overvalued.\n",
    "If the M/B of a firm falls below one but is greater than or equal to zero, we categorize it as undervalued.\n",
    "Additionally, we create several interaction dummy variables to investigate the impact of managerial and state shareholdings in overvalued firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Regression Sequence\n",
    "Our analysis follows these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin with a single OLS regression of the M/B ratio on shareholdings by managers, the state, and the relevant dummy variables.\n",
    "Subsequently, we conduct a second single regression on the M/B ratio. In this regression, we introduce squared values for both managerial and state shareholdings. This step aims to explore the possibility of a non-linear relationship between firm performance and ownership structure.\n",
    "In the next stage, we perform two-stage least-squares regressions with additional control variables. If the test results indicate that managerial shareholdings are exogenous, we revisit the single OLS regressions for further exploration. Specifically, we assess these models for heteroscedasticity.\n",
    "These steps are designed to comprehensively examine the complex interplay between ownership structure and firm performance, considering both linear and non-linear relationships and potential endogeneity issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this structured approach, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of how ownership structure impacts the performance of Russia's publicly listed companies."

    "The figures for SqSHS and SHST show no association between M/B and the squared values of managerial and state shareholdings. Besides examining the relationship between explanatory and dependent variables, it's important to explore the relationships among explanatory variables. There is a moderate negative correlation (-0.31) between state shareholdings and managerial shareholdings. This is expected because state-owned entities typically don't provide stock options or stocks to their management boards. While some state-owned companies may offer stock options, the granted amounts are negligible. However, the correlation's magnitude isn't high, allowing us to use both variables simultaneously in one model. There's also a correlation between the dummy variables, as anticipated. None of the other variables exhibits noteworthy correlations. After running a single OLS regression of M/B on managerial and state shareholdings, along with squared values of shares owned by managers and state, I test the endogeneity of management ownership using two-stage least squares regression. Long-term debt and capital expenditures relative to assets serve as instrumental (control) variables for this purpose:"

The results of the endogeneity test suggest that we cannot reject the null hypothesis, indicating that the managerial share variable is exogenous (p-values>0.05). Consequently, I proceeded to further examine the single OLS regressions. Specifically, I focused on the first OLS model since it yielded two statistically significant coefficients. To assess this model for heteroscedasticity, I created a plot of residuals against fitted values."
